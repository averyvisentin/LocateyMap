# LocateyMap
this is a collection of scripts to decode journey map data and use it in computercraft (CC: Tweaked)
reads waypoints from the JourneyMap directory and returns them as a Lua table.






# Usage

  --Save Scripts:
        Save the json.lua script, read_waypoints.lua script, and example_mine.lua script on your turtle.

  --Run the Mining Program:
        Execute the example_mine.lua script on your turtle.

  --Send Commands from the Hub:
        Use the hub computer to send commands such as readWaypoints to print waypoints or navigateTo:Example Waypoint to navigate to a specific waypoint.

Not sure how I'll be able to grab the waypoints from journey map without copying them over to CC or grabbing them from internet
